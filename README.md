# 📈 Long-Term Unemployment Statistics Dashboard

This repository presents a data visualization project focused on long-term unemployment trends across different age groups and genders over time. It combines structured labor data with interactive Tableau dashboards to highlight employment patterns and insights for policymaking and economic planning.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Long-Term-Unemployment-Statistics.xlsx`: The primary dataset used for analysis, containing unemployment counts broken down by age, gender, and time period.
- `Employee_Umployment_Status_Report.twbx`: Tableau workbook that provides dynamic visualizations and trends derived from the dataset.

## 📄 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

| Column      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Age`       | Age group (e.g., 16 to 19 years, 20 to 24 years, etc.) |
| `Gender`    | Gender category (`Men`, `Women`) |
| `Period`    | Time period in YYYY-MM-DD format (monthly intervals) |
| `Unemployed`| Number of unemployed individuals in the specified category |

Each row represents the unemployment figure for a specific age and gender group at a given time point.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Tableau Dashboard

The **Employee Employment Status Report** reveals several meaningful insights:

### 🔹 Unemployment by Age Group
- Unemployment is consistently **higher among younger age groups**, especially 20–24 years and 25–34 years.
- The 55+ age group has lower absolute unemployment numbers but shows **steadier long-term unemployment**.

### 🔹 Gender Disparities
- **Men experienced higher long-term unemployment** across most age groups, particularly during economic downturns.
- **Women** showed smaller fluctuations, possibly due to lower participation in certain industries affected by layoffs.

### 🔹 Temporal Trends
- There are visible **spikes during recession periods**, such as post-2008, indicating economic impact on job markets.
- In more recent years, unemployment trends began **flattening**, with gradual decreases across nearly all demographics.

### 🔹 Policy Implications
- Younger workers may benefit from targeted employment initiatives, internships, and reskilling programs.
- Older groups, while fewer in number, might need support to re-enter the workforce after long gaps.
